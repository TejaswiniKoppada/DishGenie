Aval Nanachathu,"Start by washing the flattened rice (aval) thoroughly to remove any dust or impurities.  

Drain the water and set the flattened rice aside to soak for about 5-10 minutes, just until it softens slightly.  

In a separate pan, heat a little ghee and add grated coconut to it.  

Saute the coconut for 2-3 minutes until it turns light golden and releases a pleasant aroma.  

Add jaggery to the pan and stir until it melts completely, forming a syrupy consistency.  

While the jaggery melts, cut a banana into small slices or pieces.  

Once the jaggery has melted and the coconut syrup is smooth, add the soaked flattened rice to the pan.  

Gently mix the flattened rice with the jaggery-coconut mixture, ensuring that each grain of rice is coated evenly with the syrup.  

Next, add the chopped banana pieces to the mixture and mix them gently to combine.  

Cook the mixture for a couple of minutes on low heat, allowing the banana to soften slightly.  

Make sure the mixture is well blended, with the jaggery syrup, coconut, and banana evenly distributed throughout the flattened rice.  

Once everything is combined, remove the pan from the heat.  

You can add a pinch of cardamom powder for an extra burst of fragrance if you prefer.

Ela Ada,"Start by preparing the banana leaves by washing them thoroughly. Cut them into square or rectangular pieces, depending on the size you want for each ada.  

Heat the banana leaves over an open flame for a few seconds to soften them, making them more pliable and easier to fold. Set them aside to cool.  

In a mixing bowl, combine rice flour and a pinch of salt.  

Gradually add water to the rice flour while mixing continuously, until you get a smooth dough. The dough should be soft and pliable, not too sticky or too dry.  

In another bowl, mix grated coconut and jaggery together. Stir until the jaggery melts into the coconut, creating a sticky filling.  

Once the jaggery and coconut are well combined, you can add a pinch of cardamom powder for fragrance if you prefer.  

Now, take one banana leaf and place a small portion of the rice flour dough in the center of the leaf.  

Flatten the dough into a small, round shape with your fingers or a spoon.  

Place a spoonful of the jaggery-coconut filling in the center of the dough.  

Fold the banana leaf over the dough to form a small parcel, making sure the edges are sealed well to prevent the filling from spilling out.  

Repeat this process with the remaining dough and filling, creating several parcels.  

Next, steam the prepared ada parcels in a steamer or a large pot with a steaming rack.  

Steam for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat, or until the rice flour is cooked and the ada is firm to touch.  

After steaming, remove the parcels from the steamer and let them cool slightly before unwrapping.  

Serve the Ela Ada warm or at room temperature.

Once the onions are cooked, add any desired spices like cumin seeds, mustard seeds, or a pinch of turmeric for flavor.  

You can also add green chilies or ginger if you want some heat and flavor.  

Stir the spices and onions together until the mixture becomes aromatic.  

Next, add the pearl millet flour (bajra flour) to the pan, and Saute it for 2-3 minutes to lightly roast the flour.  

This helps in removing any raw taste from the millet flour and enhances its flavor.  

Now, add yogurt to the mixture, stirring continuously to avoid any lumps from forming.  

Once the yogurt is well incorporated, add water to the pan to form a smooth, porridge-like consistency.  

Season the mixture with salt to taste and bring it to a simmer.  

Cover the pan and let the khichdi cook on low heat for about 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally.  

If you are using a pressure cooker, cook it for 2-3 whistles.  

Once the khichdi thickens and the millet flour is fully cooked, remove it from the heat.  

You can adjust the consistency by adding more water or yogurt if needed.  

Garnish the Bajra Khichdi with fresh coriander leaves, a dollop of yogurt, or some ghee for added richness.

In another bowl, add buckwheat flour (kuttu ka atta) and season with salt, cumin powder, and red chili powder.  

Add the mashed potatoes to the flour and mix well to combine.  

Gradually add water to form a soft dough. Be careful not to add too much water at once, as buckwheat flour absorbs moisture quickly.  

Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable. If the dough is too sticky, dust it with a little more buckwheat flour.  

Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes.  

After resting, divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a ball.  

Take one ball and flatten it with your palms. Dust it lightly with buckwheat flour to prevent it from sticking.

Add jaggery to the mixture, making sure it dissolves completely in the batter. If the jaggery is in solid form, melt it slightly before adding.  

Add a pinch of cardamom powder to the batter for flavor, and mix everything together.  

To adjust the consistency, add a little water or milk if the batter feels too thick. It should be thick but still pourable.  

Let the batter rest for about 15 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the moisture and thicken slightly.  

Meanwhile, heat a paniyaram pan (or an appe pan) on medium heat and lightly grease each cavity with ghee or oil.

In a non-stick pan, heat 2 tbsp of ghee (clarified butter) over medium heat.
Once the ghee is melted, add the almond paste to the pan and cook it, stirring constantly.

Once the mixture starts to thicken further, add 1/4 tsp of cardamom powder for a fragrant touch.
Stir in 1/4 tsp of saffron strands that have been soaked in warm milk to give the halwa a beautiful color and aroma.
Continue to cook the halwa, stirring constantly, until the ghee begins to separate from the sides.
